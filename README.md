üìÅ Project Description:


    - TASK 1: MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION
              Overview - Built a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on it's data.
              Algorithms & Classifier Used - Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression & Support Vector Machine
              Features- 1) Provided a clear understanding of how individual features contribute to the prediction the movie genres.
  

    - TASK 2: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
              Overview - Built a model to identify fraudulent transactions in a dataset of historical credit card transactions to prevent         
              unauthorized usage & protect both consumers and financial institutions.
              Algorithms & Classifier Used - Logistic Regression & Random Forest Classifier
              Features- 1) Provided a clear understanding of how individual features contribute to the prediction of fraud.
                        2) Evaluation of model performance using relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
                        3) The dataset is split into two parts: Training & Testing to evaluate their performance better.
                        4) Random Forest is used to capture complex relationships in the data and handling nonlinearities.

                        
    - TASK 3: CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
              Overview - A model to predict customer churn for a subscription- based service or business. Used historical customer data,         
              including features like usage behavior and customer demographics.
              Algorithms & Classifiers Used - Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to predict churn. 
              Features-  1) Implementation of Random Forest classifier for churn prediction.
                         2) Utilization of Gradient Boosting classifier for accurate churn prediction.
                         3) Evaluation of model performance using relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
                         

    - TASK 4: SPAM SMS DETECTION
              Overview - A robust solution for combating spam SMS using the power of Multinomial Naive Bayes!
              It is a model which distinguishes between legitimate messages and spam messages.
              Classifier Used - Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes for the prediction.
              Features- 1) Preprocessed and cleaned a diverse SMS dataset, transforming text into numerical features for the model.
                        2) Employed Naive Bayes classifier, to differentiate spam and non-spam messages.
                        3) Achieved an accuracy of 98% in classifying SMS messages as spam or not spam.
